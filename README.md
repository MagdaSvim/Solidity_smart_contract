# Solidity_smart_contract

To automate the creation of joint savings accounts, you’ll create a Solidity smart contract that accepts two user addresses. These addresses will be able to control a joint savings account. Your smart contract will use ether management functions to implement a financial institution’s requirements for providing the features of the joint savings account. These features will consist of the ability to deposit and withdraw funds from the account.

## Technologies

For this project we use the following tolls:

* [Solidity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solidity) - statically typed programming language designed for developing smart contracts that run on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)

* [Remix IDE](https://remix-project.org/) - allows developing, deploying and administering smart contracts for Ethereum like blockchains. It can also be used as a learning platform
